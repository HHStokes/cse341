This is an asssignment for **CSE 341** and my first time working with Node.js. I wasn't asked to make a 'readme' document for this, but I thought it would be good to have one.
* While some class provided code was used to ease making a serve using Node.js, none of that code is included here. Instead, you may find it [here](https://github.com/byui-cse/cse341-project). It was excluded becuase putting it here didn't make sense to me. 
* The reason this isn't called "readme" is becuase that included code had a readme file with it. I didn't want to get rid of it. 
* Part of the reason I included this was to refresh my mind on how to use marku again. I haven't fully exploited github in the past and want to become more active on it in general, so markup will be a usefull skill. 

The code on here is what I wrote for the assignment.
