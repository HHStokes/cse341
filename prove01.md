## Prove01
This is an asssignment for **CSE 341** and my first time working with Node.js. I wasn't asked to make a 'readme' document for this, but I thought it would be good to have one.
### Notes
* While some class provided code was used to ease making a serve using Node.js, none of that code is included here. Instead, you may find it [**here**][cse341-projects]. It was excluded becuase putting it here didn't make sense to me. 
* The reason this isn't called "readme" is becuase that included code had a readme file with it. I didn't want to get rid of it. 
* Part of the reason I included this was to refresh my mind on how to use marku again. I haven't fully exploited github in the past and want to become more active on it in general, so markup will be a usefull skill. Git is also something that as of writing this I want to get better at, so I wanted to exclude items I wouln't be graded on anyway. 

### What does this code do?
The code on here is what I wrote for the assignment, and should run [independant of this code][cse341-projects]. It's a server using Node.js. One page asks for a username and handles it, putting it (or creating if it does not yet exist) into a file called "_message.txt_," and displaying it on another page with dummy names.
